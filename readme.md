# **AuthFlow**

**A Complete Authentication System with JWT & Email Verification**

---

## **Project Name Explanation**

**AuthFlow** represents the seamless flow of authentication processes - from user registration to login, password management, and secure access control. It's simple, memorable, and reflects the core purpose of your project.

---

## **Project Description**

AuthFlow is a **production-ready authentication system** built for modern web applications. It provides all essential authentication features:

- **User Registration** with email validation
- **Secure Login** with JWT tokens
- **Password Management** (reset via email)
- **Protected Routes** with role-based access
- **Email Integration** for password recovery

This project was developed as a **learning exercise** to master backend development concepts, particularly authentication systems. It demonstrates:

- Proper **security practices**
- Clean **code organization**
- Effective **error handling**
- **Database integration**
- **API design** best practices

---

## **Key Features**

✅ **User Registration**

- Name, email, password validation
- Password confirmation
- Terms & conditions acceptance

✅ **Secure Login**

- JWT token generation
- Token expiration handling
- Password hashing with bcrypt

✅ **Password Management**

- Secure password reset via email
- Token-based password updates
- Password strength enforcement

✅ **Protected Routes**

- Middleware-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Token verification

✅ **Email Integration**

- Password reset emails
- Secure token links
- Nodemailer configuration
